# P3: Project pew Pew

A small Pygame project built in the context of a python class.

The project was designed to explore scene management, simple 2D animations, event-driven programming and a number of game development-related concepts.

## The Game

P3 is a rather basic game, heavily inspired by old arcade classics and directly "Laser Age" by Ingava, which I remembered playing back in the day. (https://www.old-games.com/download/2415/laser-age)

Proper balance and deep progression and systems were all beyond the scope of this learning project, and so the game offers nothing beyond linear difficulty scaling on levels, eventually becoming near-impossible.
